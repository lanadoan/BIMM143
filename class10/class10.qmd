# The PDB Database

Here we examine the size and composition of the main database of the bio molecules structures- the PDB.

Get a csv file from the PDB and read it in R.

```{r}
pdbstats<- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names=1)
  head(pdbstats)
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy

My pdbstats data frame has number with commas in them. This may cause problems.

```{r}
pdbstats$X.ray

 as.numeric(pdbstats$X.ray)
 
   x<- "22,200"
  as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))
```

We found a function called ‘gsub’ now we can figure out how it works

```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",","", x))

 gsub(",","", pdbstats$X.ray)
```

I can turn this snip-it into a function that I can use on every column.

```{r}
 commasum<- function(x){
    sum(as.numeric(gsub(",","", x)))
  }
  commasum(pdbstats$X.ray)
```

```{r}
totals<-apply(pdbstats, 2, commasum)
    
round((totals/totals["Total"]*100),2)
```

84.54% are solved by x-ray and 8.72 is solved by EM.

> Q2: What proportion of strutures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
(215684/249751891*100)
```

## 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

You can use Mol* directly at the PDB website (as well as UniProt and elsewhere). However, for the latest and greatest version we will visit the Mol* homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/.

We will play with PDB code 1HSG

# Back to R and working with PDB structures

```{r}
library(bio3d)

hiv<- read.pdb("1hsg")

hiv
```

```{r}
head(hiv$atom)
```

```{r}
pdbseq(hiv)
```

Here we will do a normal mode analysis (NMA) to predict functional motions of a kinase protein.

```{r}
adk<- read.pdb("6s36")

adk
```

```{r}
modes <- nma(adk)

plot(modes)
```

Make a “move” called a trajectory of the predicted motions:

```{r}
mktrj(modes, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
