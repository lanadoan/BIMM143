# Section 1. Proportion og G/G in a population

Downloaded a CSV file from Ensemble < https://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Variation/Sample?db=core;r=17:39894595-39895595;v=rs8067378;vdb=variation;vf=959672880#373531_tablePanel >

Here we read this CSV file

```{r}
mxl <- read.csv("373531-SampleGenotypes-Homo_sapiens_Variation_Sample_rs8067378.csv")
head(mxl)
```

```{r}
table(mxl$Genotype..forward.strand.)
```

```{r}
table(mxl$Genotype..forward.strand.) / nrow(mxl) * 100
```

Now let's look at a different population. I picked the GBR. 

```{r}
gbr <- read.csv("373522-SampleGenotypes-Homo_sapiens_Variation_Sample_rs8067378.csv")
```

Find a proportion of G|G

```{r}
round(table(gbr$Genotype..forward.strand.) / nrow(gbr) * 100, 2)
```


This varient that is assosiated sith childhood asthma is more frequent in the GBR population than the MKL population. 

Lets now dig into this further. 

## Section 4. Population Scale Analysis 

> Q13

One sample is obviously not enough to know what is happening in a population. You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a population scale. So, you processed about ~230 samples and did the normalization on a genome level. Now, you want to find whether
there is any association of the 4 asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378...) on ORMDL3 expression.

How many samples do we have?

```{r}
expr <- read.table("rs8067378_ENSG00000172057.6.txt")
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```

```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

> Q14

Let's make a boxplot.

```{r}
ggplot(expr) + 
  aes(geno,exp, fill = geno) + 
  geom_boxplot(notch = T)
```

The boxplot that I have made above shows that the SNP between G and A directly afffects expression levels. The A|A median expression is ~32, the A|G median expression is ~ 25, and the G|G median expression is ~20. A|A has the highest expression of the three and based on the results of both A|A and A|G, the A allele most likely induces more gene expression.
