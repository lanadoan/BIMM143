Here we analyze a candy dataset from the 538 website. This is a CSV file from their Github repository.

## Data Import

```{r}
candy <- read.csv("candy-data.csv",row.names = 1)
candy
```

> Q1. How many different candy types are in this dataset?

```{r}
nrow(candy)
```

> Q2. How many fruity candy types are in the dataset?

```{r}
sum(candy$fruity)
```


## Data exploration


```{r}
View(candy)
```

> Q3. What is your favorite candy in the dataset and what is it’s winpercent value?

```{r}
candy["Werther's Original Caramel", ]$winpercent
```

> Q4. What is the winpercent value for “Kit Kat”?
 
```{r}
candy["Kit Kat", ]$winpercent
```
 
> Q5. What is the winpercent value for “Tootsie Roll Snack Bars”?

```{r}
candy["Tootsie Roll Snack Bars", ]$winpercent
```

> Q What is the least liked candy in the data set

```{r}
x <- c(5, 3, 4, 1)
sort(x)
order(x)
```

```{r}
inds <- order(candy$winpercent)
head(candy[inds,])
```

```{r}
library("skimr")
skim(candy)
```


> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

winpercent

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the candy$chocolate column?

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

```{r}
hist(candy$winpercent, col = "pink", breaks = 20)
```

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No it is no symmetrical it is skewed. The mean is below 50%. 

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

Below

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit candy?

First find all chocolate candy and their $winpercent values 

Next summarize these values into one number 

The do the same to fruit candy and compare the numbers. 
 
```{r}
choc <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]
summary(choc)
```
 
```{r}
fruit <- candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruit)]
summary(fruit)
```
 
 On average chocolate is higher than fruity. 

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

```{r}
t.test(choc, fruit)
```

## Overall Candy Rankings

> Q13. What are the five least liked candy types in this set?

```{r}

```

> Q14. What are the top 5 all time favorite candy types out of this set?



> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

> Q16. This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars sorted by winpercent?

```{r}
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(x = "Win Percent", y = NULL)

ggsave('barplot1.png', width = 7, height = 10)
```

```{r}
my_cols=rep("black", nrow(candy))
my_cols[as.logical(candy$chocolate)] = "turquoise"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "violet"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) +
  geom_col(fill=my_cols) 

ggsave('barplot1color.png', width = 7, height = 10)
```

> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets

> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

## Taking a look at pricepercent

```{r}
library(ggrepel)

# How about a plot of price vs win
ggplot(candy) +
  aes(winpercent, pricepercent, label=rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col=my_cols) + 
  geom_text_repel(col=my_cols, size=3, max.overlaps = 4)
```

> Q19. Which candy type is the highest ranked in terms of winpercent for the least money - i.e. offers the most bang for your buck?



> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and of these which is the least popular?

```{r}
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)
head( candy[ord,c(11,12)], n=5 )
```

## Exploring the correlation structure

```{r}
library(corrplot)

cij <- cor(candy)
corrplot(cij)
```


> Q22. Examining this plot what two variables are anti-correlated (i.e. have minus values)?


> Q23. Similarly, what two variables are most positively correlated?


## On to PCA

The main function of this is `prcomp()` and here we know we need to scale our data with the `scale = T` 

```{r}
pca <- prcomp(candy, scale = TRUE)
summary(pca)
```

```{r}
my_data <- cbind(candy,pca$x[,1:3])
```

```{r}
ggplot(my_data) +
  aes(PC1, PC2, label = rownames(candy)) +
  geom_point(col = my_cols) +
  geom_text_repel(col = my_cols) +
  labs(title = "PCA Candy Space Map")
```

```{r}
loadings <- as.data.frame(pca$rotation)

ggplot(loadings) +
  aes(PC1, reorder(rownames(loadings), PC1)) + 
  geom_col()
```

```{r}
plot(pca$x[,1:2], col=my_cols, pch=16)
```

```{r}
p <- ggplot(my_data) + 
        aes(x=PC1, y=PC2, 
            size=winpercent/100,  
            text=rownames(my_data),
            label=rownames(my_data)) +
        geom_point(col=my_cols)

p
```
